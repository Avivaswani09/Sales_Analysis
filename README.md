## Data Preprocessing (Jupyter NOtebook using Numpy and Pandas)
The data preprocessing step involves cleaning and transforming the raw sales data to make it suitable for various analyses and machine learning models. The `Updated_Sales_Dataset.csv` file contains the cleaned dataset used in the notebooks.

## Sales Analysis
### Decision Tree and KMeans
The `Sales_DecisionTree_And_KMeans.ipynb` notebook implements a Decision Tree model and KMeans clustering to classify and group sales data for better insights.

### KMeans and Basket Analysis (Apriori)
The `Sales_KMeans_Basket(Apriori).ipynb` notebook combines KMeans clustering with Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and association rules.

### Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
The `sales_np_pd_matplot.ipynb` notebook utilizes Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### Regression Analysis
The `Sales_Regression_Analysis.ipynb` notebook implements regression analysis to understand the relationships between different sales variables and make predictions.

### RFM Analysis
The `Sales_RFM_Analysis.ipynb` notebook performs Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## Installation
To run the notebooks, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file with all necessary packages.
